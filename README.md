# enigma

In this README file I will copy/paste each section of the "Meets Expections" rubric then assess myself on that section.

Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. 
Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.
I believe I will get full points for this section. I built the classes and runner files according to the project specs,
and they are fully functional.

Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.
